      I've always been passionate about language. I'm a lifelong bibliophile and Japan enthusiast.
      I pursued these interests in college majored in English lit and Japanese (こんにちは！) After graduating, I wanted to further pursue my passion for language, and discovered programming. While not quite the same as studying literature or Japanese, programming was another way to fill my language-loving niche. I wanted this to be my career.

      I attended Dev Bootcamp in Chicago and learned the skills to launch my career as a developer. One of the best facets of Dev Bootcamp's program is it's emphasis on diverity and soft skills, as well as developing technical skills. That experience comprised both some of the most challenging and most fun weeks of my life.

      Currently, I work mostly in Ruby on Rails, but am excited to start branching out to new languages and start working toward full-stack status. For instance, I've started playing around with <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/sunrein/statisfy">Python!</a> I also stepped out from the backend and toyed around with CSS in order to create this site!
